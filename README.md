# NVidia Driver Downloader

Download the latest NVidia driver easily than ever

## Usage

* Run `Download_NVidia_Driver.ps1`
* If the script finds a newer version of NVidia driver it will inform you, download, and expand setup.
* `-Clean` provides a clean driver installation by resetting all NVidia settings to the default ones.

## Addendum

* The script provides the feature to determine your current NVidia videocard and searches for the latest available driver for your card only by parsing the NVidia cloud JSONâ€”not only the latest driver version which is presented on the NVidia DB;
* Downloads always latest 7-Zip version automatically by parsing the SourceForge cloud JSON, expands .MSI as a `portable app without installation` and run it. After creating NVidia setup, 7-Zip will be removed.
